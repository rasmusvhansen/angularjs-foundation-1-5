        <h1>A lot of stuff</h1>
        <p>This is where Dependency Injection comes into play. Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern that deals with how objects and functions get created and how they get a hold of their dependencies. Everything within Angular (directives,
          filters, controllers, services, ...) is created and wired using dependency injection. Within Angular, the DI container is called the injector.</p>

        <p>To use DI, there needs to be a place where all the things that should work together are registered. In Angular, this is the purpose of the modules. When Angular starts, it will use the configuration of the module with the name defined by the ng-app
          directive, including the configuration of all modules that this module depends on.</p>
      </content>
    </pane>

    <pane title="Pane 2">
      <content>
        <h1>This is a header</h1>
        <p>Some other content</p>
      </content>
    </pane>

    <pane title="Pane 3">
      <content>
        <h1>Some other content</h1>
        <p>Just apply a class="clearfix" to the parent element. This is an improved version of the original, and documented here.</p>

        <p>Updated by Jeff Starr to be cleaner, based on the fact that nobody uses IE for Mac, which is what the backslash hack was all about.</p>
      </content>
    </pane>

    <pane title="Pane 4">
      <content>
        <h1>Even more content</h1>
        <p>This looks like normal HTML, with some new markup. In Angular, a file like this is called a template. When Angular starts your application, it parses and processes this new markup from the template using the compiler. The loaded, transformed and
          rendered DOM is then called the view.</p>

        <p>The first kind of new markup are the directives. They apply special behavior to attributes or elements in the HTML. In the example above we use the ng-app attribute, which is linked to a directive that automatically initializes our application.
          Angular also defines a directive for the input element that adds extra behavior to the element. The ng-model directive stores/updates the value of the input field into/from a variable.</p>
